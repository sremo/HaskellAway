Monads 10 in Haskell can be thought of as composable computation descriptions. The essence of monad is thus separation of composition timeline from the composed computation's execution timeline, as well as the ability of computation to implicitly carry extra data as pertaining to the computation itself in addition to its one (hence the name) output. This lends monads to supplementing pure calculations with features like I/O, common environment or state, and to preprocessing of computations (simplification, optimization etc.).
